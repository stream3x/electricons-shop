      shortDescription: "With new technology being released every year, designers frequently wonder what is the best desktop computer for graphic design, so I reviewed them all to give my top picks.",
      description: "As a graphic designer, you want to have a smooth workflow, easy multitasking, and quick rendering, but without going overboard with specs or features that you might not use. Choosing the best computer for graphic design comes down to what you’ll need to use it for, as well as your ideal desk configuration and budget. Once you find the one you like, I recommend getting slightly higher specs than you need right now, so that it’s “future-proof” to some extent and it will be able to keep up as your programs and workloads become more intensive. Also keep in mind that some of these computers come with a monitor as a package, but the rest won’t — so you’ll need to set aside a budget for a good monitor as well.",

      images: [{image: "/images/amd_desktop/amd_ryzen.png"}, {image: "/images/amd_desktop/desktop_ryzen.png"}],
      shortDescription: "Grand Theft Auto V is one of the best-selling video games of all time. Developed by Rockstar North, it was initially released on 7th-generation consoles way back in 2013, and only made its way to PC in April 2015. PC gamers had to wait, but our version of the game released with an entirely new first person mode, along with a more fleshed-out online mode.",
      description: "This guide will take an in-depth look at GTA V’s graphical demands, and what type of PC hardware you need to play the game to your satisfaction. If you just want to know what to buy without all the in-depth analysis, you can skip to the recommendations sections.GTA V runs on the Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE), the engine that Rockstar has been using in one form or another since 2006. The game contains a lot of advanced settings, including levels of shadow detail and antialiasing that are getting more common in newer PC releases.The game is quite tough on PC hardware. You will require a very solid build in order to play GTA V on its highest settings, especially with full anti-aliasing. With that said, the game is still playable on mid-tier machines. Let us take a look at what Logical Increments tier you should build to play Grand Theft Auto V. We recommend PC builds in 'tiers', with each tier containing the most powerful, most reliable, and least expensive combination of parts for that price. We don't list the individual parts in this guide because they change frequently based on local prices and new releases. You can see the latest individual part choices for each tier at the main guide page, which is updated regularly. Open it in a new tab to compare: Logical Increments PC Parts Guide. You can also see a comparison between GPUs in our Graphics Card Comparison page.",

      shortDescription: "Before we break down the individual components of our AMD build path, let’s discuss what you can expect from an $800 gaming PC. While this is considered to be in the mid-range, it has become harder due to current stock issues and price hikes. These components are sure to cope with any AAA game titles you throw at them when gaming in 1080p.",
      description: "What You Get For Your $800? Certain compromises have to be made when trying to stay within our $800 target. While you may not be able to get more than six cores from your CPU or an RTX GPU, you can still achieve high FPS in high settings with this PC. AMD’s processors bring brilliant value to the table, meaning you are always able to get great all-round performance for your money. Regardless of which build path you choose, you are going to get a PC that not only performs well but looks good too. Performance? This gaming PC will play any game you throw at it, and this is thanks to the combination of components. While you get a lot less for your money these days, this is still going to provide you with a solid 1080p gaming experience. To ensure high levels of gaming performance, we had to compromise on the size of the SSD. That being said, the 480GB SSD is plenty to get you going and will provide you with space for your operating system and favorite games. This SSD solution will ensure you get quicker boot times from your system and will enhance your gaming performance too. Along with the storage solution, we see 16GB of fast RAM included. While you could argue this is slightly more than needed in this price range, it future-proofs your system, giving you less to upgrade at a later stage.",

      shortDescription: "Find out if AMD's Ryzen 5 5500 processor is good for gaming based on our evaluation and comparison in terms of core type, core count, frequencies, and cache capacity, along with its overclocking, PCIe, and DDR support.",
      description: "When selecting a CPU for gaming, we have experienced that the most important characteristics are the single-core clock speed (or frequency), number of cores and threads, cache size, and type of memory it supports. Additional considerations like integrated graphics and overclocking needs may also influence your selection. This article evaluates AMD's Ryzen 5 5500 desktop CPU. We evaluated AMD's Ryzen 5 5500 and compared it to others to determine which provides the best value as a gaming CPU. We shaped our testing methodology to focus on each CPU's attributes rather than solely on benchmarks. This article helps you make an informed decision by comparing the CPU's attributes, such as the core types, core counts, frequencies, cache capacities, overclocking capabilities, PCIe support, and DDR support. We've examined these attributes for multiple CPUs to help you compare their abilities. By understanding these key factors, you can determine which CPU will best suit your needs and provide the performance you desire. When selecting a CPU, it's essential to consider your specific needs and use case. For example, most gamers will want to prioritize high clock speeds and single-threaded performance. However, suppose we have additional video editing or rendering needs. In that case, we like to get a CPU with a high core count and multi-core boost frequency. We investigated the capabilities of multiple AMD and Intel CPUs to compare them objectively. Your CPU selection will ultimately depend on your specific requirements, budget, and priorities. However, by examining the attributes of each CPU, we aim to provide you with the information needed to make an informed decision when choosing a gaming CPU.",

      shortDescription: "A couple of years ago, Huawei climbed to the top of the smartphone market, surpassing Samsung and Apple in the number of phones shipped. The Chinese company was about to take on the US market but then came the ban and all went downhill from there.",
      description: "Google services are out of the question on Huawei phones of late, and the company tries to push its own Harmony OS with the Huawei AppGallery store. Whether it will be a success or not, we don’t know. What we do know is that we tested some of the latest Huawei phones, and they’re not half bad. So, for all the Huawei fans out there, we’ve compiled a list of the best Huawei phones in 2023. There are some great choices here, some of which predate the US ban, so you can get the best of both worlds: a technologically advanced handset with Google goodness inside. We're also waiting for the Huawei P60 Pro flagship to be officially announced, so stay tuned for that as well. Let’s go!",
